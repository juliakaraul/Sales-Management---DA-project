## Business Request
The business request for this data analysis project was an executive report for sales managers.
The main request was to get a dashboard overview of internet sales, in order to follow the best-selling products (both per customer and per product) as well as sales over time against budget.

## Data Cleaning & Transformation (SQL)
To create the necessary data model for the analysis and fulfill business needs, the following tables were extracted using SQL.

One data source (sales budgets) was provided in Excel format and was connected in the data model later in the process.

## Data Model
After cleaned and prepared tables were loaded into Power BI, two factual tables and three dimensional tables were connected to each other.

## Sales Management Dashboard
In the final step, a sales management dashboard was created, where the first page acts as an overview and two other pages focus on combining tables for necessary details and visualizations to show sales over time, per customer, and products. The report includes graphs and KPIs, which compare sales against budget, and also allows filtering data for each customer and product.
